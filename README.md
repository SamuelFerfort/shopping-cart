## Overview

This is a practice Single Page Application (SPA) built using React. It incorporates React Router for navigation, fetches data from an API with error and loading states, and uses React PropTypes for type checking. The project also leverages CSS modules for styling and organizes components into separate files for better readability and maintainability.

## Features

- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Utilizes React Router for seamless navigation without page reloads.
- **API Integration**: Fetches data from an external API, handling both loading and error states gracefully.
- **PropTypes**: Ensures components receive the correct props, improving reliability and ease of debugging.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped CSS to components to prevent style conflicts.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Components are organized into individual files, making the project easier to extend and understand.
